# 346CloudComputingFinalProject

My final project for CSC346 Cloud Computing.

Goal: To create a web service that could be accessed by multiple machines at once.  This must be able to be run on a single or on multiple AWS server instances.

What I created: A canvas of pixels that a user can paint.  Pixel information is stored in Google's Firestore database and shown to all current online users in realtime.

Created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.  Account information handled through Google's OAuth.

2 short, 90 Second video demonstrations can be found here:
